## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **SRI - Stratum V2 Reference Implementation**. 

[Stratum V2](https://stratumprotocol.org) is a next-generation bitcoin mining protocol designed to enhance the efficiency, security, flexibility and decentralization. 
SRI is fully open-source, community-developed, independent of any single entity, aiming to be fully compatible with [Stratum V2 Specification](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec).

## ⛏️ Getting Started

To get started with the Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), please follow the detailed setup instructions available on the official website:

[Getting Started with Stratum V2](https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/)

This guide provides all the necessary information on prerequisites, installation, and configuration to help you begin using, testing or contributing to SRI.

## 🚀 Use Cases

The library is modular to address different use-cases and desired functionality. Examples include:

### 👷 Miners

- SV1 Miners can use the translator proxy (`roles/translator`) to connect with a SV2-compatible pool.
- SV1 mining farms mining to a SV2-compatible pool gain some of the security and efficiency improvements SV2 offers over Stratum V1 (SV1). The SV1<->SV2 translator proxy does not support  _all_ the features of SV2, but works as a temporary measure before upgrading completely to SV2-compatible firmware. (The SV1<->SV2 translation proxy implementation is a work in progress.)

### 🛠️ Pools

- Pools supporting SV2 can deploy the open source binary crate (`roles/pool`) to offer their clients (miners participating in said pool) an SV2-compatible pool.
- The Rust helper library provides a suite of tools for mining pools to build custom SV2 compatible pool implementations.
- The C library provides a set of FFI bindings to the Rust helper library for miners to integrate SV2 into their existing firmware stack.

## 🛣 Roadmap 

Our roadmap is publicly available, outlining current and future plans. Decisions on the roadmap are made through a consensus-driven approach, through participation on dev meetings, Discord or GitHub.

[View the SRI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/stratum-mining/projects/5)

### 🏅 Project Maturity

Low-level crates (`protocols` directory) are considered **beta** software. Rust API Docs is a [work-in-progress](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/845), and the community should still expect small breaking API changes and patches.

Application-level crates (`roles` directory) are considered **alpha** software, and bugs are expected. They should be used as a guide on how to consume the low-level crates as dependencies.

### 🎯 Goals

The goals of this project are to provide:

1. A robust set of Stratum V2 (SV2) primitives as Rust library crates which anyone can use
   to expand the protocol or implement a role. For example:
   - Pools supporting SV2
   - Mining-device/hashrate producers integrating SV2 into their firmware
   - Bitcoin nodes implementing Template Provider to build the `blocktemplate`
2. The above Rust primitives as a C library available for use in other languages via FFI.
3. A set of helpers built on top of the above primitives and the external Bitcoin-related Rust crates for anyone to implement the SV2 roles.
4. An open-source implementation of a SV2 proxy for miners.
5. An open-source implementation of a SV2 pool for mining pool operators.
