//! Serde serializer/deserializer for [stratum v2][Sv2] implemented following [serde

//! Serilalizer and Deserializer are implemented using slices in order to reduce copies:
//!
//! ## Fixed length primitives:
//! Each fixed length Sv2 primitive type when deserialized contains a view in the input buffer so
//! no copy is needed to deserialize raw bytes.
//!
//! ## Non fixed legth primitives
//! Non fixed length primitives can be diveded in strings, byte sequences and general sequences.
//!
//! ### Strings
//! Strings are automatically handled by Serde
//!
//! ### Generic sequences
//! Non byte sequences `SEQ0_255[T]` and  `SEQ0_64K[T]` are implemented as a
//! struct that contains two optional field:
//! * an optional view in the input buffer
//! * an optional slice of T
//!
//! When the sequence is constructed from a serialized message we just get a view in the input
//! buffer and no data is copyed.
//!
//! When the sequence is constructed from [T] the sequnce can safely point to them without
//! transmute.
//!
//! ### Bytes sequences
//! Byte sequences can be limited length sequences or unlimited length sequences, the latter are
//! automatically handled by Serde.
//! Limited length byte sequences are not implemented as a specific new type of generic sequences
//! cause:
//! * For the rust type system a serialized byte array and a deserialized byte array are the same
//!   thing, that is not true for generic sequences.
//! * In order to not copy data around generic sequences need to be implemented as struct containing
//!   two optional field, a slice of byte and a slice of T.
//! * This dicotomy is not needed for byte sequences so they are implemented as specific smaller
//! struct.
//!
//! ## Why not rkyv?
//! [rkyv][rkyv1] is a a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. I do not know rkyv but it
//! seems that the objective of this library could have been readched with less effort and
//! [better][rkyv2] using rykv instad then serder.
//!
//! Btw Serde is like standard for rust code, very safe and stable. The
//! deserialization/serialization part will be in the code that need to be added to bitcoin core, so
//! it must use the most safe and stable option. That do not exclude that a
//! serialization/deserialization backend can be implemented with rykv and then used by the
//! subprotocols crates via a conditional compilation flag!
