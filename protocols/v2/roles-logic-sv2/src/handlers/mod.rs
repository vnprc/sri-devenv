//! Handlers are divided per (sub)protocol and per Downstream/Upstream.
//! Each (sup)protocol defines a handler for both the Upstream node and the Downstream node
//! Handlers are a trait called `Parse[Downstream/Upstream][(sub)protocol]`
//! (eg. `ParseDownstreamCommonMessages`).
//!
//! When implemented, the handler makes the `handle_message_[(sub)protoco](..)` (e.g.
//! `handle_message_common(..)`) function available.
//!
//! The trait requires the implementer to define one function for each message type that a role
//! defined by the (sub)protocol and the Upstream/Downstream state could receive.
//!
//! This function will always take a mutable ref to `self`, a message payload + message type, and
//! the routing logic.
//! Using `parsers` in `crate::parser`, the payload and message type are parsed in an actual SV2
//! message.
//! Routing logic is used in order to select the correct Downstream/Upstream to which the message
//! must be relayed/sent.
//! Routing logic is used to update the request id when needed.
//! After that, the specific function for the message type (implemented by the implementer) is
//! called with the SV2 message and the remote that must receive the message.
//!
//! A `Result<SendTo_, Error>` is returned and it is the duty of the implementer to send the
//! message.
